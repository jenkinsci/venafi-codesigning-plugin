<p>The digest algorithm(s) to use to creating signatures.</p>
<p>
    If none specified, 'sha256' is used as the default algorithm. This is very secure,
    but may not be compatible with older Windows versions. If you need compatibility
    with older Windows versions, you should specify 'sha1' and 'sha256' (in that order).
</p>
<p>
    When multiple digest algorithms are specified, they are applied in the order specified.
