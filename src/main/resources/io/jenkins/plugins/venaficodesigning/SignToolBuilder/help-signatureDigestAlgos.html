<p>The digest algorithm(s) to use to creating signatures.</p>
<p>
    If not specified, 'sha256' is used as the default algorithm. This is very secure,
    but may not be compatible with older Windows versions. If you need compatibility
    with older Windows versions, you should specify 'sha1 sha256'.
</p>
<p>
    You can specify multiple ones by separating them with a space. Like this: 'sha1 sha256'.
    When multiple digest algorithms are specified, they are applied in the order specified.
